# Simple HTTP Request

Craft multipart and form-urlencoded POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP requests (returns NSMutableURLRequest). 
Simple functionality, no external dependencies. You will have to create your own 
delegates, etc. This types of post requests should handle several common cases, 
designed to work with Automated Reference Counting (ARC).

*Note*: Usage should be self explanatory in SimpleHTTPRequest.m comments.
